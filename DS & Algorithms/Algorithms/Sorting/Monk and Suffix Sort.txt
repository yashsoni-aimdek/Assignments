Question :

Monk loves to play games. On his birthday, his friend gifted him a string S. Monk and his friend started playing a new game called as Suffix Game. In Suffix Game, Monk's friend will ask him lexicographically kth smallest suffix of the string S. Monk wants to eat the cake first so he asked you to play the game.


Code :

import java.util.*;

class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        String s = sc.next(); // getting string 
        int k=sc.nextInt(); 

        String[] output=new String[s.length()]; //creating a String where length of the string is defined
        for(int i=0;i<output.length;i++){ //for loop for getting all the suffices
            output[i]=s.substring(i);   //storing strings 1 by 1 in output array
        }
        Arrays.sort(output); //sorting the output array in alphabatical order
        System.out.println(output[k-1]); //printing the kth value in the array.
    }
}

Input :

aacb 3

Output :
