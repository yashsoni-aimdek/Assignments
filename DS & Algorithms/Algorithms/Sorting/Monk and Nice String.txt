Question :
Monk's best friend Micro's birthday is coming up. Micro likes Nice Strings very much, so Monk decided to gift him one. Monk is having N nice strings, so he'll choose one from those. But before he selects one, he need to know the Niceness value of all of those. Strings are arranged in an array A, and the Niceness value of string at position i is defined as the number of strings having position less than i which are lexicographicaly smaller than A[i]. Since nowadays, Monk is very busy with the Code Monk Series, he asked for your help.
Note: Array's index starts from 1.

Code :

import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.*;

class TestClass {
    public static void main(String args[] ) throws Exception {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();                   //taking n number of array input
        String[] arr = new String[1010];
        int j=0;
        arr[0]="A";                            //storing A in the first position
        for(int i=1; i <= n; i++){              //for loop for taking 1 by 1 inputs and comparing them
            String str = "";
            str=sc.next();                     //storing the string in the string variable
            for(j = i - 1; j >= 0;j--){         //for loop for comparing string values
                if(arr[j].compareTo(str) >= 0){  //if jth value is same or greater than string
                    arr[j+1] = arr[j];         //storing the jth value to the next jth value
                }else{
                    break;
                }
            }
            System.out.println(j);              //printing j
            arr[j+1] = str;                    //storing the string in next arr[j]
        }
    }
}

Input :

Output :
